# BirdReader

## Introduction

In March 2013, Google announced that Google Reader was to be closed. I used Google Reader every day so I set out to find a replacement.
I started with other online offerings, but then I thought "I could build one". So I created BirdReader which I have released to the world
in its unpolished "alpha".

BirdReader is designed to be installed on your own webserver or laptop, running Node.js. e.g.

* on an old PC
* on a cloud server e.g. AWS
* on a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)

## Features

* import your old Google Reader subscriptions 
* fetches RSS every 15 minutes
* web-based aggregated newsfeed
** mark articles as read
** delete articles without reading
** 'star' articles
** sorted in newest-first order
** bootstrap-based, responsive layout

## How does it work?

BirdReader doesn't store anything locally other than its source code and your configuration. The data is stored in Cloudant (CouchDB) database in the cloud.
You will need to sign up for a free Cloudant account (disclaimer: other hosted CouchDB services are available, and this code should work with any
CouchDB server e.g. your own).

Two databases are used:

### feeds database

The 'feeds' database stores a document per RSS feed you are subscribed to e.g.

```
{
    "_id": "f1cf38b2f6ffbbb69e75df476310b3a6",
    "_rev": "8-6ad06e42183368bd696aec8d25eb03a1",
    "text": "The GitHub Blog",
    "title": "The GitHub Blog",
    "type": "rss",
    "xmlUrl": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/github",
    "htmlUrl": "http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=13d93fdc3d1fb71d8baa50a1e8b50381",
    "tags": ["OpenSource"],
    "lastModified": "2013-03-14 15:06:03 +00:00"
}
```

This data is directly imported from the Google Checkout OPML file and crucially stores:

* the url which contains the feed data (xmlUrl)
* the last modification date of the newest article on that feed (lastModified)

### articles database

The 'articles' database stores a document per article e.g. :

```
{
    "_id": "3c582426df29863513500a736111fa4e",
    "_rev": "1-b49944fd0edf8f50fc17c6562d75169e",
    "feedName": "BBC Entertainment",
    "tags": ["BBC"],
    "title": "VIDEO: Iran planning to sue over Argo",
    "description": "Best Picture winner Argo has been criticised by the Iranian authorities over its portrayal of the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.",
    "pubDate": "2013-03-15T15:20:31.000Z",
    "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21805140#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa",
    "pubDateTS": 1363360831,
    "read": false,
    "starred": false
}
```

The _id and _rev fields are generated by CouchDB. The feedName and tags come from the feed where the article originated. 
The rest of the fields come form the RSS article itself apart from 'read' and 'starred' which we add to record whether an 
article has been consumed or favourited.

### Views

Cloudant/CouchDB only allows data to be retrieved by its "_id" unless you define a "view". We have three views on the articles database:

* unreadbyts - unread articles in timestamp order
* readbyts - read articles in timestamp order
* starredbyts - starred articles in timestamp order

This allows us to query our data in three ways: unread articles, read articles or starred articles.

### Scraping articles

Every so often, BirdReader fetches all the feeds using the [feedparser](https://npmjs.org/package/feedparser). Any articles newer than
the feed's previous newest article is saved to the articles database.

## What does it look like?

The site is built with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) so that it provides a decent interface on desktop and mobile browsers
